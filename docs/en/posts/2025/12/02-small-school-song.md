# Small School Song

<!-- DESC SEP -->

I know a girl, radiant and graceful

<!-- DESC SEP -->

I know a girl, radiant and graceful

Everyone says she’s the blossom of beauty

I know a boy, dashing and tender

Everyone says he’s a star of China

I’d walk with her through mountains and forests

I’d hold his hand to the ends of the earth

We watch the moon together, count the stars together

We watch the moon together, count the stars together
