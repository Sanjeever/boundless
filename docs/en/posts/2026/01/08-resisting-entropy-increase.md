# Resisting Entropy Increase

<!-- DESC SEP -->

All architecture and engineering are essentially tragic attempts by humanity to forcibly establish and maintain a momentary "order" in a universe tending towards disorder (entropy increase).

<!-- DESC SEP -->

## Rust and Dust

If you calm your mind and observe an abandoned factory, or merely an unattended electrical box by the roadside, you will see the universe's most primitive will.

Paint peels off, exposing the metal beneath; oxygen and moisture greedily pounce, oxidizing iron atoms into reddish-brown rust. Concrete surfaces develop tiny cracks; water seeps in, expands during freeze-thaw cycles, and splits the hard stone. Plant roots spread within brick joints, slowly but firmly disintegrating the walls.

This is not accidental destruction; this is the iron law of physics. The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that in a closed system, entropy—that is, the degree of disorder—always tends to increase. Energy tends to disperse, structures tend to disintegrate, and order tends towards disorder.

From microscopic particles to macroscopic celestial bodies, everything is rushing towards heat death. That is the ultimate destiny of the universe: absolute uniformity, absolute cold, absolute silence.

## Builders Against the Current

However, humanity was born. We are negative entropy entities produced by random fluctuations. We not only maintain our own order but also presumptuously attempt to establish order in the world outside us.

This is the essence of engineering.

When an engineer draws the first line on a blueprint, they are effectively declaring war on the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

Look at those skyscrapers. Gravity wants to pull them back to the ground, turning them into a pile of rubble. Structural engineers calculate the paths of force flow, build skeletons with steel and concrete, and forcibly suspend massive weight in the air, resisting the pull of gravity.

Look at those precise drainage systems. Water flow always tends to spread disorderly, eroding foundations. Water supply and drainage engineers design slopes, pipes, and siphon systems, utilizing principles of fluid mechanics to tame the violent rainwater, making it obediently flow along predetermined paths, carrying away mud and debris.

Every bolt tightened, every weld connected, every layer of waterproofing laid, is injecting "negative entropy" into a system inevitably heading towards chaos. With wisdom and energy, we forcibly carve out a small territory of order in the chaotic universe.

## Maintenance: A Game Against Time

Laypeople often only see the glamour at the inauguration ceremony, but true engineers know that "completion" is only the beginning of the war.

The real challenge lies in "maintenance".

In many people's eyes, maintenance is just simple repair: changing a light bulb when it breaks, painting a wall when it gets dirty. But on a philosophical level, maintenance is a long game against time.

Every inspection action, every injection of lubricant, every replacement of aging parts is delaying the process of entropy increase. We are constantly inputting energy and information into the system to offset the ubiquitous erosion of nature.

Without maintenance, a modern skyscraper would become uninhabitable within fifty years, a dangerous building within two hundred years, and completely collapse within five hundred years. Nature has infinite time and patience; it will use wind, rain, lightning, and microorganisms to take back the order we stole from it, bit by bit.

The work of maintainers is often silent and hidden. They walk in the depths of utility tunnels and climb to the tops of tower cranes. What they resist is not just malfunctions, but the fundamental laws of the universe.

## The Dignity of Sisyphus

Since everything will eventually return to dust, since all buildings will eventually collapse, and all machines will eventually stop turning, does everything we do still have meaning?

This reminds me of Sisyphus in Camus's writing. He was punished by the gods, forced to push a boulder up a mountain, only for the boulder to roll down every time it was about to reach the peak. He was destined to eternally repeat this futile labor.

But Sisyphus is happy.

Because in the process of pushing the stone up the mountain, he confirms his existence through resistance. Engineering and architecture are the same.

We know full well that entropy increase is irreversible, and we know full well that all order is temporary, but we still choose to build, to maintain. In our limited time, we have created geometric precision, structural logic, and functional elegance.

This momentary "order" is the embodiment of human dignity.

When we stand under a magnificent bridge, watching it span a chasm; when we gaze at a precisely operating server room, watching data flow orderly within it. The beauty we feel comes not only from the technology itself but also from a tragic heroism—

In a universe destined for destruction, we stubbornly erect monuments one after another, proving that we have been here, we have thought, and we have used reason and our hands to resist that boundless void.
