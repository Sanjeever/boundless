# The Poverty of Abundance

<!-- DESC SEP -->

The internet has erased the information gap, but it hasn't erased the gap between individuals. When knowledge is everywhere, why do we remain stagnant?

## The Ashes of the Library of Alexandria

Legend has it that the Library of Alexandria housed all the wisdom of humanity at the time. If it still stood, we might consider it the ultimate sanctuary of knowledge.

Today, everyone carries a thousand Libraries of Alexandria in their pocket. With an internet connection, you can look up the latest quantum physics papers, watch open courses from top Ivy League universities, or even have the most powerful AI teach you to code step-by-step.

Information Asymmetry, a term that once built countless business empires and class barriers, seems to be ruthlessly erased by technology. Theoretically, a village teenager and a Silicon Valley elite are equal in their access to knowledge.

However, reality presents us with a grim paradox: **The cost of acquiring information approaches zero, yet the number of people achieving breakthroughs through information has not seen an explosive growth.**

Instead, we have fallen into a state of "The Poverty of Abundance". We stand in a vast ocean of knowledge, yet die of thirst on the shore.

## False Satisfaction in the Favorites

The first root of this predicament lies in our brain's ancient reward mechanism being deceived by modern technology.

In the hunter-gatherer era, finding and storing food was key to survival. Therefore, when we "acquire" a resource, the brain releases dopamine as a reward.

In the digital age, this mechanism has dislocated. When you see an article titled "The Ultimate Guide to Architecture Design" and click "Favorite", your brain produces an illusion: **It thinks you already possess this knowledge.**

That action of "favoriting" completes a psychological loop in that instant. You feel satisfied, secure, as if the wisdom in that article has already been injected into your neurons. Then, you contentedly swipe to the next video.

**Hoarding has replaced Learning.**

We store hundreds of gigabytes of tutorials on our hard drives and pile up thousands of articles in our "read later" lists. These digital "corpses" do not automatically transform into wisdom. They only constantly remind us: You could have been excellent, but you did nothing.

This readily available convenience dissolves the weight that knowledge should carry.

## The Disappearance of Friction

In the past, learning was a process full of "friction".

You had to flip through card catalogs in the library, wander among bookshelves, and chew on a concept or two amidst obscure texts. This process was full of frustration, time-consuming, and physically demanding.

But it was precisely this friction that forced you to slow down. During the search and reading, your brain was constantly building context, piecing together fragments, and engaging in deep cognitive processing.

Knowledge acquisition today is too smooth.

Want to know something? Ask GPT. In a second, the answer is before your eyes.
Want to learn something? Watch a 10-minute "crash course" video.

**Only results, no process.**

However, human intellectual breakthroughs often do not happen the moment an answer is obtained, but on the journey of seeking the answer. Just like fitness, muscle growth requires resistance. If you use a mechanical exoskeleton to help you lift dumbbells, your muscles will never get stronger.

The internet has eliminated the resistance to acquiring knowledge, but it has also deprived us of the opportunity to exercise our mental muscles. We have become giant infants being fed, swallowing highly processed "knowledge liquid food", while gradually losing the ability to chew on hard reality.

## The Map is Not the Territory

A deeper fracture lies in the huge chasm between "knowing" and "doing".

The internet provides the **Map**.
Real life is the **Territory**.

The knowledge on the internet is mostly "maps" that have been abstracted, compressed, and logicalized. They are clear, perfect, and self-consistent. You look at the map and feel everything is under control: from point A to point B, there are only three steps.

But when you truly step into the territory, you will find swamps not marked on the map, sudden rainstorms, and thorns that make every step difficult.

The reason most people fail to achieve significant breakthroughs is that they mistake having the map for having walked the journey.

They have read all the startup methodologies but have never truly set up a stall to sell a single item;
They are familiar with all programming design patterns but have never solved a specific bug in spaghetti code through refactoring;
They have listened to all communication techniques but still dare not speak out their opposing opinions loudly in meetings.

**The elimination of the information gap has instead highlighted the cruelty of the "action gap".**

When everyone has a map, the only competitive barrier is who can truly step out, step into pitfalls, sweat, and establish order in the chaotic real world.

## Epilogue

In this era of information overload, the greatest privilege is no longer "accessing information", but "blocking information" and "deep processing".

True breakthroughs no longer come from how many books you have read or how many articles you have collected.

It comes from closing the webpage, opening the door, and walking into that real world full of uncertainty. It comes from your willingness to endure boredom and engage in long-cycle deliberate practice. It comes from your ambition not to be a porter of knowledge, but a practitioner of knowledge.

Knowledge is everywhere, but wisdom only reveals itself in action.

Don't be the person who starves to death guarding a full granary. Start a fire, cook, and eat.
